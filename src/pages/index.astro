			<h1>ðŸ‘‹ðŸ§‘ Hello, Human!</h1>
			<p>
				This is a silly little website that exists with a singluar idea in mind. It's nothing groundbreak or special but it's important nonetheless. 
				We exist in a complex world full of interesting times, big ideas, and complicated humans. 
			</p>
			<p>				
				Many of these humans are friends, family, or colleagues. Some of these humans are stranges, but all of these strangers are humans.
			</p>
			
			<p>Very simply: <i><b>Humans are not resouces</b></i></p>
