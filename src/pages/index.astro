      <h1>ðŸ‘‹ðŸ§‘ Hello, Human!</h1>
      <p>
        We exist in a complex world full of interesting times, big ideas, and
        complicated humans.
      </p>

      <p>
        Many of these humans are friends, family, or colleagues. Some of these
        humans are strangers, but all of these strangers are humans.
      </p>

      <p>
        This website is none of those things. It exists with a singular idea in
        mind. It's nothing groundbreaking or special but it's important
        nonetheless.
      </p>

      <p>Very simply: <i><b>Humans are not resources</b></i></p>

      <p>
        Examples of resources as generally understood::
        <ul>
          <li>Oil</li>
          <li>Water</li>
          <li>Food</li>
          <li>Electricity</li>
          <li>Gas</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>
        Examples of humans:
        <ul>
          <li>You</li>
          <li>Me</li>
        </ul>
